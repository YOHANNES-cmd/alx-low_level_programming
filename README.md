## C Language Introduction
C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development. Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++).

4-puts.c - C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

5-printf.c - C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.

6-size.c - C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

7. What happens when you type gcc main.c
